# Contributing

We are very open to contribution and we encourage it. There are several ways to contribute to this list:

## Filing an issue

Those that do not want to do the work can file an issue in [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/LinuxCafeFederation/awesome-gnu-linux-gaming/issues), in [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/TheMainGroup/awesome-gnu-linux-gaming/-/issues) or in [GitHub](https://github.com/TheEvilSkeleton/awesome-gnu-linux-gaming/issues). While we do accept poorly written issues, we will appreciate if you spend your time writing an easy-to-read issue, for example:

```
# Category:

AMD GPU

# Name:

ACO compiler

# Link(s):

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AMDGPU#ACO_compiler 

# Brief description:

Open source shader compiler by Valve Corporation to compete with the LLVM compiler, AMDVLK drivers drivers and Windows 10.
```

## Submitting a merge request

If you want to submit merge requests, then you are free to do so. The only requirement to submit merge requests is to do them in **[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/linuxcafefederation/awesome-gnu-linux-gaming/-/merge_requests)** as our [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/LinuxCafeFederation/awesome-gnu-linux-gaming) and [GitHub](https://github.com/LinuxCafeFederation/awesome-gnu-linux-gaming) repositories are mirrored from our [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/linuxcafefederation/awesome-gnu-linux-gaming/-/merge_requests) repository.

Do keep in mind that we will **not** accept all submitted merge requests, some examples being troll merge requests and incomprehensible texts. We will appreciate if you put a relevant message in each commit, as well as make your edits uniform with ours so we will not have to edit much.

We thank you in advance for contributing in GNU/Linux gaming!
